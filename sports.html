		<h2>Sports are cool </h2>
		<p> Sports are a great way to stay healthy, have fun, and competition against other teams and players. Here are some of my favorite sports playing and watching. All sports are very challenging and need tones of practice to get better at the sport you are trying to perfect.</p>
		
		<h3>These are my favorite sports that are in order from my favorite to least favorite</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Soccer</li>
			<li>Golf</li>
			<li>Basketball</li>
